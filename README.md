# Renderer
The renderer that has yet to be named.

If you want to change the glsl version. You must change the values in the vertex shader, fragment shader, main.cpp, and debug.cpp.

## Model Files
In the model files write all the float values in order for the verticies array.
No letters.
Negative numbers allowed.
Ignores extra spaces.
Ignores lines that start with // for comments.

Stuff to do:
* Add normals to the vertex shader properly
  * Add normals to the model files
* Add multiple object rendering
* Add lighting
* Add smoothable models like spheres
* Add raycasting support for basic reflections
* Add support for loading external models
* Clean up movement code
* Create or implement an already created physics engine
* Implement animation support
